# yourballot
`yourballot` is an application designed to enable voters to more easily gather information around the
political candidates they may find on their ballots.

Too often it is far too difficult to find candidates' stances on the issues. This only becomes more true
the more local (or smaller) the election. `yourballot` is meant to take the remove the burden of research
from the voter who wishes to be well-informed. By using `yourballot` voters should be able to provide
their views on political issues and instantly be matched with the candidates who most closely align
with these same views.


## Disclaimer
`yourballot` is still under development and is not a fully functional application

## Tech stack
`yourballot` utilizes Django to serve as the backend for the [frontend companion application](https://github.com/peteherman/yourballot-ios) written
in swift. `yourballot` was hosted locally on my own hardware running a homegrown kubernetes cluster.
